# E-Commerce Frontend Web App - by Omid Neshati


## Introduction

Welcome to my E-Commerce Frontend Web App! This project is a one-person effort, created by Omid Neshati, using Next.js 13. It incorporates some exciting new features, such as Tailwind CSS for a stunning user interface, and a fake API for quick and easy development. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features

1. **Home Page**: The home page showcases featured products and promotions based on user preferences.

2. **Categories Page**: Users can explore various product categories, making it easy to find what they are looking for quickly.

3. **Cart Page**: The cart page allows users to view their selected items, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.

4. **Register Page**: New users can create an account by filling out the registration form. The registration page is designed to be user-friendly and secure.

5. **Login Page**: Existing users can log in to their accounts through the login form. Security measures are in place to protect user information.

## New Features

### Next.js 13

I have upgraded to the latest version of Next.js (v13) to take advantage of its improved performance, smaller bundle sizes, and faster startup times. This means an even better user experience for our customers.

### Tailwind CSS

The frontend is now powered by Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable utility-first CSS framework. It enables us to create stunning, responsive designs with ease, providing a visually pleasing shopping experience.

### Fake API

During development, I utilize a fake API to simulate interactions with the backend. This allows me to work independently and test various scenarios without relying on the actual backend services.

## MVVM Pattern

I have implemented the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to maintain a clear separation of concerns. This ensures that the codebase is organized, maintainable, and easier to scale.

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Renders the user interface and receives user input.
- **ViewModel**: Mediates communication between the Model and View, handling data operations and business logic.
